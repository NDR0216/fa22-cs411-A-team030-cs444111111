## Project Summary
The name of the project “The Susruta Project” is to commemorate Susruta, one of the earliest wellness influencers that promoted exercise to stay healthy. The project aims at building a healthy lifestyle community by providing users a platform to have a shared community for their workout routine and it also encourages them to add their daily recipes to their workout camp. 

Specifically, users would be able to search for videos ranging from HIIT&crossfit, aerobic&cardio, yoga&pilates, to stretching&balance. With the application, they would have access to workout videos made by professional trainers. There is also a video section for recipes, and users can search for recipe videos based on workout types. Besides, the application offers forums for the users to discuss their exercise experiences to either motivate other users to watch the same video/join the same channel/list some heads-ups to which type of workout might not be ideal for some particular groups. Users can also share their complementary “what they eat for the day” recipes and their workout practice to promote healthier lifestyles for the whole community.
