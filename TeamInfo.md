## Project Summary

The name of the project “The Susruta Project” is to commemorate Susruta, one of the earliest wellness influencers that promoted exercise to stay healthy. This application aims at building a healthy lifestyle community by providing users a platform to have a shared community for their workout routine and it also encourages them to add their daily recipes to their workout camp. Specifically, users will sign up for courses ranging from yoga, cardio to weight. By signing up for the courses, they will have access to the workout videos made by professional trainers of each sub-community and also forums and personal fitness data analysis. There will be forums for the users to discuss their exercise experiences to either motivate the other users to take the same classes or to list some heads-ups to which type of workout might not be ideal for some particular groups. In each sub-community (e.g. a yoga club is a sub-community to the entire healthy lifestyle community), users can also share their complementary “what they eat for the day” recipe along with their workout practice to promote healthier lifestyles for the whole community. Every week, there will be a rank of the total hours of workout videos and also a rank for the most liked recipe from the users.
